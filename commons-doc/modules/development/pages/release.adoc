= Make a release to `X.Y.Z`

== Upgrade to a RELEASE version

=== In the main project

* Before change the version, ensure that you have installed the current version in your local repository : otherwise, you will have some issues in releasing Eclipse and Benchmarks.

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* 

Define the new version.

----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion='X.Y.Z'
----

* (Un)Comment the timestamp in `maven-bundle-plugin` at `Bundle-Version`, configured with `.${maven.build.timestamp}`.

* Install the new version in your local repository.

=== In Eclipse project

* 

As previously, ensure that you have installed the current version in your local repository.

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Update the `parent.version` in the root `pom.xml` according to the new version, as previously set, but not others.

* Define the new version.

*NOTE:* If it's a SNAPSHOT, add `.qualifier` instead of `-SNAPSHOT`.

*NOTE2:* It will remove the `parent.version` in the root `pom.xml` because it's the same of the parent. Re-set it to the current version.

----
mvn tycho-versions:set-version -DnewVersion='X.Y.Z'
----

* Update `feature.xml` in features and `category.xml` in the update-site: remove `.qualifier` for NeoEMF dependencies.

* Install the new version in your local repository.

=== In benchmarks project

The procedure is the same as in the main project.

== Publish the release in Github

* Commit *(without push)* the modifications
* Tag the commit with name `vX.Y.Z`

= Deploy a release

*NOTE:* Only the main project have to be deployed in Maven central !

OSS-RH has some http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html[requirements] to accept the release.
One of them is the signature of the artifacts: A full description is available http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html[here], describing how to create his key.

Maven must be configured to handle signature and deployment.
The following `settings.xml` file must be filled and placed at the root of your `.m2` directory:

[source,xml]
----
<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>ossrh</id>
            <username>{OSS-USERNAME}</username>
            <password>{OSS-PASSWORD}</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
----

Once is done, you can deploy your artifacts on Maven Central with the following:

----
mvn clean deploy -DskipTests -P deploy-artifacts
----

Artifacts are now staged and wait for validation and deployment on the https://oss.sonatype.org[Nexus Repo Manager] (Note that staged artifacts, are not definitive, they can be removed/cancelled): A full description of different steps is available http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html[here].

= Upgrade to a SNAPSHOT version

Once you have deployed yor artifacts, to avoid overwritten your release, you must upgrade your project in a SNAPSHOT state.
Repeat the several steps described in the <<upgrade-to-a-release-version,Upgrade to a RELEASE version>> section by adding `-SNAPSHOT` or `.qualifier`.

Once is done, you can now commit and push the changes in GitHub.
